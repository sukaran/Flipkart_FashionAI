This time of the year is perfect to go through the day and kick it around town in a blazer and some classic oxford shoes.

It adds in just enough subtle details to tie in the whole outfit together.

It works well because the charcoal grey is a darker shade for the season and the bold pattern is much more subtle this way. A great way to break away from the essential grey and navy suits that everyone has in their wardrobe. Setting the bar in the office for what great work style can be. Pair the plaid suit with a purple dot tie for a nice pop, a complementing pattern mix combo. Then step it up with a black monkstrap shoe with the Kilitie.'",b'black:Bar III shoes;'
